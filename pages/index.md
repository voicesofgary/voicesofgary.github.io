​
This is Gary! We, **the voices of Gary**, possess the soil of victors reclaiming beauty from ashes and forging as continued story of inspiration through love. It is not a mission to be tackled alone, but one that requires the assistance and involvement of our entire community, near and far.  This is a movement to “Be the Change!” and "Lift our Voices!" This movement is redefining your narrative to “Victory Way.” This defines the overcoming and better times ahead focusing on this community’s strength and vast opportunities on the horizon!​ (by Joslyn RW Kelly)​
